My Proposal for Context Engineering Protocols:
1. Naming Convention for "Constellation" Roadmaps:

Star-Cluster: The main, high-level ROADMAP.md will remain as is, serving as our "Star-Cluster."

Constellations: For each phase detailed in the ROADMAP.md, we will create a dedicated Markdown file. I propose the following naming convention for clarity:

ROADMAP_PHASE_0_SETUP.md

ROADMAP_PHASE_1_CORE.md

ROADMAP_PHASE_2_ADVANCED.md

ROADMAP_PHASE_3_UIUX.md

ROADMAP_PHASE_4_DEPLOYMENT.md

This convention clearly links the detailed roadmap to its corresponding phase in the main "Star-Cluster" document.

2. Content & Granularity for "Constellation" Roadmaps:

Each "Constellation" roadmap will expand upon its respective phase from the "Star-Cluster" ROADMAP.md by including:

Detailed Sub-Tasks: Break down each high-level task into actionable, smaller steps.

Technical Implementation Details:

Specific Flutter widgets and packages to be used.

Firestore queries and data manipulation logic.

Firebase Storage interaction details.

Offline persistence implementation specifics (e.g., how Firestore's offline capabilities will be leveraged, local image caching strategy).

Specific Markdown library integration notes.

Authentication flow intricacies.

API/Data Model Refinements: Any further granular details on the data model or API interactions relevant to that phase.

Testing Strategy for the Phase: How we plan to ensure the quality and correctness of the features developed within that specific phase (e.g., unit tests, widget tests, integration tests).

Potential Challenges/Considerations: Early identification of potential technical hurdles or complex design decisions within the phase.

Acceptance Criteria: Clear definitions of what constitutes "done" for each major sub-task in the phase.

3. Maintaining Consistency:

Each "Constellation" roadmap will explicitly state its relationship to the main ROADMAP.md.

The MIT License (subject to change) will be reiterated in each constellation document.

The critical directive to not give away any personal data in documentation will be strictly adhered to across all levels of documentation.

4. Benefits of this Layered Approach:

Clarity & Focus: Developers can focus on the current "Constellation" without being overwhelmed by the entire project scope.

Modular Planning: Allows for agile adjustments to specific phases without disrupting the overall project vision.

Improved Onboarding: New team members can quickly grasp the project at a high level, then dive into the relevant phase details.

Better Progress Tracking: Easier to track progress against smaller, more defined tasks.
